# MusicCRS Part 4: how to test the advanced features

How to try each Part 4 feature in the chat and from the command line: the lines to type, the
expected reply, and the check scripts. A feature is added here when its task is done
(see `part4_plan_simple.md`). Setup, the LLM key and the Part 2 demo are in `part2_demo.md`.

All commands are for **Git Bash**, from the **repo root**.

---

## 1. Start the system

```bash
conda activate musiccrs
python -m musiccrs.musiccrs            # backend on :5000; wait for the startup messages
cd frontend && npm start               # frontend on :3000 (second terminal)
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>. Slash commands work without the LLM key; natural language needs
`LLM_API_KEY` (see `part2_demo.md` §1).

## 2. Features

(Each finished task adds a subsection here: what to type, what should come back, which check to run.)
